///
/// The logic of this function is roughly
///
/// - Keep track of states that can help make parsing other things easier (see below)
/// - If the first non-whitespace character is '<', we're not an an Assembly instruction
///     - But could be in a memory dump
///     - Otherwise if the '<' is not the first a character
///         - Check if it's an assembly instruction jump + label or a memory dump
/// - If "(bad)" is found, the Assembly instruction is malformed.
///     - (bad_instruction) grammar rule already exists. So we just return `false`
/// - If '#' is found, it means these possibilities
///     - The Assembly instruction has ended (and a comment begins)
///     - An ARM register was found (if so, keep going. We're still in an Assembly instruction)
///
/// Important States:
///     - EXPECTED_BYTES_COUNT
///         - When parsing, if a hexadecimal byte is found ...
///             - Scan ahead to find all bytes. Store this count in EXPECTED_BYTES_COUNT
///         - Later, when checking "is the a memory dump or an assembly instruction", refer back to
///           EXPECTED_BYTES_COUNT. A memory dump's length must match EXPECTED_BYTES_COUNT
///     - EXPECTED_BYTES_WIDTH
///         - x86_64 tends to show bytes as 2 values at a time. e.g. `01 fa ab`, etc.
///         - ARM may show bytes 2/4/8 values at a time. e.g. `01fa abab 1001`, etc.
///         - Instructions like `addb` can be mistaken as a byte
///         - Despite the differing conventions, one constant is this:
///             - Per-line, every byte is always the same width (there's no
///             2-byte and 4-byte in the same line)
///         - Using the above assumption, `EXPECTED_BYTES_WIDTH` exists
///
///         - If a hexadecimal byte is found and `EXPECTED_BYTES_WIDTH` is unset
///             - Set it once and remember it for the rest of the line
///         - Once the line completes, set it back to 0
///         - A hexadecimal is not "found" unless it satisfies `EXPECTED_BYTES_WIDTH`
///
/// \param lexer The current position in a parse.
